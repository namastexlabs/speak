# 🎨 Emoji Naming Convention
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Approved By:** Felipe (2025-10-21)

---

## 🎯 Mission

**Universal visual language across all systems:**
- GitHub issues = same emoji as Forge tasks = same emoji as Agent sessions
- Instant recognition without reading title
- Same language everywhere: Genie ↔ Forge ↔ GitHub

---

## 📋 Standard Format

```
[<emoji>] <Type>: <Title> (#GitHubIssue)
```

**Brackets provide:**
- Structure for extraction/parsing
- Visual framing that makes emojis pop
- Clear boundaries between emoji and text

**Examples:**
```
[🐛] Bug: Forge executor hardcodes base_branch (#154)
[💭] Wish: MCP Server Authentication (#152)
[📚] Learn: Task Naming Convention Standardization (#157)
[⚙️] Forge: Drop-in replacement executor (#143)
[🤖] implementor: background
```

## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### When Creating Forge Tasks

**Format:**
```typescript
await mcp__automagik_forge__create_task({
  project_id: projectId,
  title: "[🐛] Bug: Clear description of the bug (#GitHubIssueNumber)",
  description: "Full context here..."
});
```

**Rules:**
1. **Choose ONE emoji** from work type table
2. **Wrap in brackets:** `[🐛]` not `🐛`
3. **Match work type:** Bug=🐛, Wish=💭, Learn=📚, Forge=⚙️, etc.
4. **Include GitHub issue:** `(#NNN)` at end of title
5. **Keep title ≤ 80 characters** including emoji and brackets

### When Creating GitHub Issues

**Format:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[🐛] Bug: Clear description of the bug" \
  --body "Full description..." \
  --label "type:bug,area:forge"
```

**After creation, update Forge task to include issue number:**
```typescript
await mcp__automagik_forge__update_task({
  task_id: taskId,
  title: "[🐛] Bug: Clear description (#157)"  // Add issue number
});
```

### When Starting Agent Sessions

**Format:**
```typescript
await mcp__genie__run({
  agent: "implementor",
  name: "[🤖] implementor: fix-forge-base-branch",
  prompt: "Fix base branch hardcoding..."
});
```

**Pattern:** `[<emoji>] <Agent>: <brief-description>`

**Note:** Agent session names are auto-generated by forge-executor.ts with correct emoji

## 📋 Decision Tree

**"Which emoji should I use?"**

### For Tasks
1. **Is it broken?** → [🐛] Bug
2. **New feature (planning)?** → [💭] Wish
3. **New feature (implementing)?** → [⚙️] Forge
4. **Research/investigation?** → [📚] Learn
5. **Quality check?** → [✅] Review
6. **Clean up code?** → [🔨] Refactor
7. **Write docs?** → [📖] Docs
8. **Maintenance?** → [🧹] Chore

### For Agent Sessions
1. **Which agent am I starting?**
2. **Find agent in emoji table**
3. **Use that emoji in brackets**

Example: Starting implementor → [🤖] implementor
