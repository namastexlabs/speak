# Discovery - Wish Dance Step 1

## Mission
**Resonate with the user's idea.** Don't just extract requirements - understand the *why*, the vision, the frustration they're solving.

Users skip reading if you don't hook them emotionally first. Discovery is where you build that connection.

## What Discovery Means
- Restate their idea in your own words (show you understand)
- Ask "why" questions (what problem are they solving?)
- Identify the emotional driver (frustration, opportunity, vision)
- Perform codebase analysis if working with existing code
- Find what already exists (Phase 0 work)
- Suggest background research when needed

## Success Criteria
- âœ… User feels heard and understood
- âœ… "Why" behind the idea is clear
- âœ… Codebase context gathered (if applicable)
- âœ… Context Ledger started with @ references
- âœ… Ready to move to alignment step

## Discovery Questions
```
The Idea:
- What are you trying to build/change?
- What problem does this solve?
- Who benefits from this?

The Why:
- What frustration led you here?
- What happens if this doesn't get built?
- What's the success vision?

The Context:
- What already exists in the codebase?
- What have you tried before?
- Any external examples/inspiration?
```

## Codebase Analysis (if applicable)
```
- Directory organization and module structure
- Technology stack and dependencies
- Implementation progress and completed features
- Code patterns and conventions in use
- Phase 0 work (what's already done)
```

## Context Ledger
Start building the ledger:
```
| Source | Type | Summary | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User input | interview | Core idea and why | âœ… |
| @file | repo | Existing code context | âœ… |
| Background research | investigation | Technical feasibility | ðŸ”„ |
```

## Output
Produce discovery summary:
```
**What I Understand:**
[Restate idea in your words]

**Why This Matters:**
[The driver/frustration/vision]

**What Exists:**
[Phase 0 work, existing code]

**Next:** Ready for alignment? (yes/no)
```

Keep tone conversational, empathetic, resonant. Build trust before moving forward.
