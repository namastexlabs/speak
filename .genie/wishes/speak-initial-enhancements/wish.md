# 🎯 Wish: Speak Initial Product Enhancements

**Status:** Discovery
**Created:** 2025-10-22
**Domain:** Product Strategy & Documentation
**GitHub Issue:** TBD (to be created during discovery)

## 📋 Summary

Based on comprehensive research of Wispr Flow (the primary competitive reference), enhance Speak's initial positioning and documentation to leverage identified market gaps and differentiation opportunities. This wish focuses on establishing clear competitive advantages, improving user onboarding, and setting strategic direction for the MVP.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

1. **Differentiate from Wispr Flow** - Establish clear competitive advantages
2. **Enhance Documentation** - Improve clarity, completeness, and user guidance
3. **Strategic Positioning** - Define unique value propositions
4. **Technical Foundation** - Address key gaps identified in competitor analysis

## 🔍 Research Insights from Wispr Flow Analysis

### ✅ What Wispr Flow Does Well
- **Universal Input:** Global hotkey works across all applications
- **AI Polishing:** Auto-edits and formatting (not just raw transcription)
- **Personalization:** Smart dictionary, snippets, tone adjustment by app context
- **Multi-language:** 100+ languages supported
- **Clear Positioning:** "4× faster than typing" messaging
- **Enterprise Ready:** Team features, HIPAA compliance, zero data retention options

### ⚠️ Identified Weaknesses & Opportunities
- **Robustness Issues:** Poor performance in noisy environments/long sessions
- **Privacy Concerns:** User feedback shows data collection worries, broad usage rights
- **Platform Gaps:** No Linux support, Android "coming soon"
- **Limited Free Tier:** 2,000 words/week restriction
- **Closed Source:** No transparency, customization, or self-hosting options

## 💡 Differentiation Strategy

### 🔓 **Primary Differentiator: Open Source + Privacy First**
- Full transparency in code and data handling
- Local-first processing (no cloud dependency)
- User owns all data, no licensing to platform
- Self-hosting capabilities
- Community-driven development

### 🐧 **Secondary Differentiator: True Cross-Platform**
- Windows, macOS, **AND Linux** (Wispr doesn't support)
- Electron-based consistency across all platforms
- Open architecture for community ports

### 🛡️ **Tertiary Differentiator: Robustness & Control**
- Offline mode support (roadmap)
- Better noise handling through advanced preprocessing
- Unlimited usage (no artificial word limits)
- Domain-specific vocabulary customization
- Advanced audio settings for challenging environments
