Speak works best at 16kHz sample rate for Whisper model compatibility.

#### Channels: Mono
Single channel (mono) recording is recommended for voice dictation.

#### Bit Depth: 16-bit
16-bit audio provides the best balance of quality and file size.

## ‚ö° Hotkey Configuration

### Default Hotkey: Ctrl+Win

**How to use:**
1. Position cursor where you want text to appear
2. Hold **Ctrl+Win** (both keys together)
3. Start speaking clearly

2. Go to "Hotkey" tab
3. Click "Change Hotkey"
4. Press your desired key combination
5. Test the new hotkey

### Hotkey Tips

- **Use both modifier keys**: Ctrl+Win works reliably across applications
- **Avoid common shortcuts**: Don't use Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, etc.
- **Test in different apps**: Make sure it works where you need it
- **Backup option**: Set Ctrl+Alt+Space as secondary hotkey

## üîë API Configuration (Optional)

### Why You Need an API Key
- **Cloud mode**: Higher accuracy, faster processing
- **Offline mode**: Coming soon (no API key needed)

### Getting an OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key (keep it secure!)

### Adding Your API Key to Speak
1. Open Speak settings
2. Go to "API" tab
3. Paste your API key
4. Click "Validate"
5. Select your preferred model

### Model Options
- **gpt-4o-transcribe**: Highest accuracy (recommended)
- **gpt-4o-mini-transcribe**: Faster, cheaper
- **gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize**: Meeting mode with speaker identification

## üß™ Testing Speak

### Basic Test
1. Open any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.)
2. Position cursor in empty document
3. Hold Ctrl+Win and say: "Hello world, this is Speak working perfectly."
4. Release keys
5. Check that text appeared

### Advanced Test
1. Open your favorite application (Word, browser, email, etc.)
2. Navigate to a text field
3. Dictate a longer paragraph
4. Test different speaking speeds and volumes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Text Not Appearing
- **Check hotkey**: Make sure you're holding both keys
- **Cursor position**: Click where you want text to appear first
- **Application focus**: Make sure target app is active
- **Permissions**: Verify microphone and accessibility permissions

### Poor Audio Quality
- **Microphone selection**: Try different microphone in settings
- **Background noise**: Move to quieter location
- **Microphone position**: Speak closer to microphone
- **Test recording**: Use audio settings to verify input

### High Latency
- **Internet connection**: Faster connection = lower latency
- **Model selection**: Try gpt-4o-mini for speed
- **Audio length**: Shorter phrases process faster
- **System resources**: Close other applications

### Permission Issues

#### Windows
- Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí Allow apps to access microphone
- Enable "Allow desktop apps to access microphone"

#### macOS
- System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí Enable Speak
- System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Enable Speak

#### Linux
- Check PulseAudio/PipeWire permissions
- Run: `pactl list sources` to verify microphone detection
