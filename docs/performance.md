# Robustness & Performance Guide

## üéØ Optimizing Speak for Real-World Use

Speak is designed to work reliably in challenging conditions. This guide helps you get the best performance in noisy environments, during long dictation sessions, and across different use cases.

## üîä Noisy Environments

### Understanding Audio Challenges

**Background noise** is the #1 factor affecting transcription accuracy. Unlike Wispr Flow, Speak includes advanced preprocessing to handle real-world conditions.

### Microphone Selection

#### Good Budget Options
- **Fifine K669B:** USB condenser with noise reduction ($50)
- **Blue Snowball:** Entry-level with decent noise handling ($50)

#### Built-in Options
- **MacBook Pro microphones:** Excellent noise cancellation
- **Recent Windows laptops:** Often include good noise reduction
- **Avoid:** Cheap earbuds or phone microphones

### Audio Settings Optimization

#### Noise Reduction Levels
```yaml
# Recommended settings for different environments
quiet_office:
  noise_reduction: light
  sensitivity: balanced

noisy_cafe:
  noise_reduction: medium
  sensitivity: sensitive

construction_site:
  noise_reduction: heavy
  sensitivity: conservative
```

#### Advanced Audio Processing
- **Echo cancellation:** Reduces room reverb
- **Wind noise reduction:** For outdoor use
- **Low-cut filter:** Removes rumble and bass noise
- **De-essing:** Reduces harsh S sounds

### Environmental Optimization

#### Room Setup
- **Soft furnishings:** Carpets, curtains reduce echo
- **Microphone position:** 6-8 inches from mouth, slightly off-axis
- **Speaker distance:** Stay 2+ feet from external speakers
- **Ventilation noise:** Position away from AC/heat vents

#### Speaking Techniques
- **Clear articulation:** Exaggerate consonants slightly
- **Consistent volume:** Speak at steady level
- **Pause between sentences:** Helps with sentence detection
- **Face microphone:** Direct sound toward pickup pattern

### Testing Your Setup

#### Noise Floor Test
1. Sit quietly and record 10 seconds of silence
2. Check audio levels - should be under -40dB
3. Play white noise or music at typical volume
4. Record and verify transcription quality
