# PTT and UI Upgrade Implementation

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- ✅ `uiohook-napi` (v1.5.4) - Native key event handling for true PTT
- ✅ `tailwindcss` (v4.1.15) - Utility-first CSS framework
- ✅ `daisyui` (v5.3.8) - Component library with luxury theme
- ✅ `@tailwindcss/cli` (v4.1.15) - Tailwind CSS build tool

### 2. Files Created

#### PTT System
- ✅ `src/hotkey/ptt-manager.js` - Native PTT implementation using uiohook-napi
  - Supports hold-to-talk (press and hold to record, release to stop)
  - Cross-platform (Windows/macOS)
  - Minimum hold time (200ms) to prevent accidental triggers
  - Proper key combination detection

#### UI Files
- ✅ `src/renderer/styles.css` - Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI configuration with luxury theme
- ✅ `src/renderer/styles.built.css` - Built CSS output (generated)
- ✅ `src/renderer/index.html` - Complete UI rewrite with:
  - Timeline view (like Flow app)
  - DaisyUI luxury theme
  - Stats display (streak, words, WPM)
  - Sidebar navigation
  - Empty state
  - Recording status indicator

- ✅ `src/renderer/timeline.js` - Timeline UI logic:
  - Load and display transcription history
  - Update stats
  - Handle PTT events
  - Render timeline by date (Today/Yesterday/This Week)

#### History System
- ✅ `src/config/history.js` - Transcription history manager
  - Store transcriptions with timestamp, word count, duration
  - Group by date (today/yesterday/week/older)
  - Calculate stats (total words, WPM, streak)
  - Search functionality
  - Limit to 1000 transcriptions

### 3. Main Process Integration **✅ COMPLETED**
- ✅ Imported PTT manager and history system (src/main.js:25-26)
- ✅ Added history IPC handlers (src/main.js:332-346)
- ✅ Save transcriptions to history (src/main.js:247-258)
- ✅ Replaced old hotkey system with PTT manager (src/main.js:414-439)
- ✅ Added PTT cleanup on app quit (src/main.js:463)
- ✅ Disabled notification spamming (added `fromHotkey` flag)
- ✅ Modified `start-recording` and `stop-recording` handlers to accept options

### 4. Build System **✅ COMPLETED**
- ✅ Added `build:css` script to package.json
- ✅ Added `watch:css` script for development
- ✅ Built Tailwind CSS (styles.built.css generated)
- ✅ Updated index.html to use built CSS

## ✅ Integration Complete - Ready for Testing

All integration tasks have been completed. The application is now ready for testing on Windows.
